Whizzimo Desktop Client for Windows

# Developers notes

## Configurations

The desktop client contains a `app.config.js` file to configure the application. As such any modifications to the configurations should NOT be made in `index.js`, but instead in the `app.config.js` file for smooth configurations. Any future configurations should be made in the `config` object as follows:

```javascript
const config = {
  .......
  CONFIGURATION_GOES_HERE: CONFIG_VAL_GOES_HERE
}
```

Then export the config object in addtional scripts:

```javascript
const config = require("./app.config")();
```

## How to use

- install npm dependenices using `npm install`
- then run the same command in the `whizzimo-source` directory
- Run `npm run start` to start the app and make changes to code where neccessary

## Menu Templating

Each menu for the menubar and the tray icon menu [removed] has a menu template in the `whizzimo-source/templates` directory. Each file must be ended with `.template.js` to denote templates and future templates except HTML files must be placed in the `whizzimo-source/templates` directory.

## Testing

To create tests for the app use the [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) Testing frameworks for unit testing and [Spectron](https://electronjs.org/spectron) for integration testing the electron UI (already included). Be sure to place the test files in the `whizzimo-source/test` directory and name the files with the `.spec.js` file extension for consistency. Run each test with the `npm test` command.

## Building the app

use the `npm run pack` command on the `whizzimo-source` directory then use go back to the `whizzimo-app` directory and run `npm run build` to build the installer and update file for the updated app.
